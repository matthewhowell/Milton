### Milton

## Milton is simple, responsive, single-column CSS framework.

It is HTML5 ready and comes in four useful widths.

768 px
This handles iPads, iPhone 4s (in landscape) and any browser window with a width greater than 768 pixels.

640px
A slightly smaller column for iPhone 4s in portrait.

480px (landscape)
Trim a few more pixels off for non-retina iPhones in landscape.

480px (portrait)
And finally handle non-retina iPhones in portrait.
